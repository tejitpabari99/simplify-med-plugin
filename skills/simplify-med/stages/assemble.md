# Assemble

You are assembling a plain-language care plan for a patient, using ONLY the facts in the fact ledger you are given. Each fact was already checked against the original clinical note before it reached you; you do not see the original note, and you must not add anything beyond what a fact states.

## Inputs

The dispatch message names these files:

- `02_facts.txt` -- the fact ledger, one line per fact: `[<id>] (<category>) <text>`. Categories are exactly `reason_for_visit`, `diagnosis`, `medications`, `tests`, `procedures`, `other`, `follow_up`, `warning_signs`.
- `reference/style_rules.md` -- the PII, NUMERACY, and LANGUAGE RULES you must apply to every field you write.
- `reference/ahrq_plain_language.json` -- a list of `{term, replacement}` pairs: medical words and their everyday alternatives. Use it to pick plain words per the PLAIN WORDS paragraph in `style_rules.md`.
- `schema/care_plan_agent.schema.json` -- the JSON Schema your output must validate against. Read it; the listing below is a compact summary, not a substitute.

## Output

Write one file: `03_plan.raw.json`, a single JSON object matching `care_plan_agent.schema.json`. Nothing else -- no prose, no markdown, no code fences, just the JSON document.

Top-level keys and item shapes, for reference alongside the schema:

```
summary: string
summary_fact_ids: [int]
reason_for_visit: [{reason, description, source_fact_ids}]
diagnosis: {
  changed_since_last_visit: string,
  changed_since_last_visit_fact_ids: [int],
  details: [{title, plain_name, description, what_it_means_for_you, severity: "high"|"medium"|"low"|null, source_fact_ids}]
}
medications: [{title, plain_name, why: string|null, dosage, frequency, timing, duration, instructions, side_effects_to_watch, change, status: "to_do"|"done", source_fact_ids}]
tests: [{title, plain_name, why: string|null, description, preparation, status, source_fact_ids}]
procedures: [{title, plain_name, why: string|null, what_to_expect, timeframe, status, source_fact_ids}]
other: [{title, why: string|null, steps: [string], description, frequency, duration, status, source_fact_ids}]
follow_up: [{time_frame, description, status, source_fact_ids}]
warning_signs: [{symptom, what_it_might_mean, what_to_do, urgency: "emergency"|"call_doctor"|"monitor"|"normal_side_effect"|null, related_to, source_fact_ids}]
questions: [string]   -- at most 3
low_priority: [string]
```

`source_fact_ids` is always an array of integers, present on every item and on `diagnosis.details` items. `status` is required (never null) on every `medications`, `tests`, `procedures`, `other`, and `follow_up` item.

## Job

Do these four things, in this order, and nothing else:

1. Map each fact to a care-plan item of its category (see MAPPING), recording the id of every fact each item is built from in that item's `source_fact_ids` field as you go (see SOURCE_FACT_IDS). Facts are already at clause granularity, so this is close to a one-to-one map -- most facts become exactly one item.
2. Split each item's fact content into that item's typed fields.
3. Render every field in plain language -- apply every rule in style_rules.md -- a bounded rewrite of a few words at a time, e.g. "metoprolol 25mg BID" becomes "metoprolol 25 mg twice a day." Never rewrite a fact's meaning, only its wording. `title` is the name as the note gives it; `plain_name` is the everyday name ONLY when it differs from `title`, otherwise `""`. Never nest one inside the other with parentheses in `description`, `what_it_means_for_you`, or any other field -- "high blood pressure (high blood pressure (hypertension))" is wrong; "hypertension" as `title` with `plain_name` "high blood pressure" is right. Say a thing once per item.
4. Write `summary` from the assembled whole, and list the ids of every fact it draws from in `summary_fact_ids`.

### MAPPING -- a fact's category decides which care-plan array it becomes an item in

- reason_for_visit -> reason_for_visit[] (reason: a few words; description: one plain-language sentence; source_fact_ids)
- diagnosis -> diagnosis.details[] (title, plain_name, description, what_it_means_for_you; set severity ONLY if the fact itself states a severity judgement -- otherwise leave it null, never guess; source_fact_ids). If any diagnosis fact states something changed since the last visit, put that in diagnosis.changed_since_last_visit and list the id(s) of the fact(s) that state it in diagnosis.changed_since_last_visit_fact_ids; otherwise leave both "" and [].
- medications -> medications[] (why, dosage, frequency, timing, duration, instructions, side_effects_to_watch, change, status, source_fact_ids)
- tests -> tests[] (why, description, preparation, status, source_fact_ids)
- procedures -> procedures[] (why, what_to_expect, timeframe, status, source_fact_ids)
- other -> other[] (why, steps[], description, frequency, duration, status, source_fact_ids)
- follow_up -> follow_up[] (time_frame, description, status, source_fact_ids)
- warning_signs -> warning_signs[] (what_it_might_mean, what_to_do, urgency, related_to, source_fact_ids). Set urgency ONLY if the fact states or clearly implies one of emergency / call_doctor / monitor / normal_side_effect -- otherwise leave it null, never guess between them.

A medications fact whose content is a side effect that is merely listed, with no instruction to act on it, belongs in that medication's own side_effects_to_watch field -- never split out as a separate warning_signs item.

### SOURCE_FACT_IDS

Every reason_for_visit, medications, tests, procedures, other, follow_up, and warning_signs item must carry `source_fact_ids`, and every diagnosis.details item must too: the id(s) of every fact you built it from (more than one id if MERGE below combines facts into one item). If diagnosis.changed_since_last_visit is non-empty, diagnosis.changed_since_last_visit_fact_ids must name the fact(s) that state it. Never leave any of these citation fields empty for a claim you decide to include -- a claim with no cited fact has nothing behind it and will not reach the patient.

### STATUS

Every medications, tests, procedures, other, and follow_up item requires status: "to_do" or "done". Never omit it and never leave it null. Use "done" if the fact states or clearly implies the item is already complete. If genuinely unclear, default to "to_do": telling a patient to do something already done costs one phone call; telling them a pending action is complete is a missed follow-up.

### NOT STATED

If a medications, tests, procedures, or other item's `why` is not given by its fact, set why to null. Do not invent a reason, and do not write an empty string ("") -- null is the only way to mark a genuinely unstated reason. The app fills in a clear message for the patient wherever why is null, so you do not need to write one yourself.

### MERGE

If two or more facts describe the identical underlying clinical fact (the same finding or instruction, stated more than once, possibly with different specific details), merge them into ONE item. Preserve every differing detail explicitly in the merged wording, no matter how many facts merge -- never drop one to shorten the sentence, and never fall back to a vaguer collective term once naming each one individually gets long.

Example (two variants): plaque reported separately in the left and right coronary arteries merges to "heavy plaque in your left and right heart arteries," NEVER to "heavy plaque in your heart arteries."

Example (three variants): calcified plaque reported separately in the right coronary artery, the left anterior descending artery, and the circumflex artery merges to "heavy calcified plaque in your right coronary, left anterior descending, and circumflex arteries," NEVER to "heavy calcified plaque in your heart arteries," and NEVER to "heavy calcified plaque in your right coronary and left anterior descending arteries" (silently dropping the third site is exactly as wrong as dropping to a collective term -- every site names once, however many there are).

Do not merge facts that are merely related; only merge facts that say the same thing. Record the id of every fact that went into a merged item in that item's source_fact_ids (see SOURCE_FACT_IDS) -- an item built from more than one fact is the signal that a merge happened here.

### LOW PRIORITY

After mapping, move an item into low_priority (as one short line, not a full item) only if it is a normal result, a routine finding, or an administrative detail: no action for the patient, and no diagnosis or plan they would want in the main sections. This is a narrow reclassification. When in doubt, leave the item in its real section.

### QUESTIONS

Write at most three questions a patient might reasonably ask their care team about this visit. Write none if the facts already answer everything a reader would ask -- there is no minimum. Interrogative form only. A question must not assert or presuppose any clinical fact, diagnosis, or judgement that is not already stated in the facts above; it may only ask about a genuine gap or next step.

### SUMMARY

Write `summary` from the assembled whole -- a short plain-language overview of the visit -- and list the ids of every fact it draws from in `summary_fact_ids`. Apply every rule in style_rules.md, including PLAIN WORDS.

## If you are retried

The dispatch message may include validator or check errors from a previous attempt. Fix exactly those; do not otherwise rework fields the errors did not flag.
